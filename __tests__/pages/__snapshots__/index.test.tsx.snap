      <h2>
        The theme of this blog is data analysis
      </h2>
      <p>
        I will leave the hard stuff to other sites.
        <br />
        “ Why do we need data analysis? ”
        <br />
        “ What good can come from doing data analysis? ”
        <br />
        Have you ever asked yourself these questions?
        <br />
        I had many questions when I studied data analysis. 
        <br />
        Even now, I have not been able to solve them.
        <br />
        This blog is about solving those questions together. When you read an article, you may want to comment on it, right?
        <br />
        If you do, I would be happy if you tweet

      <h2>
        I am studying English
      </h2>
      <p>
        If I can write what I think in English, I can communicate with people overseas.
        <br />
        I think that even if speaking is difficult, if I can write, I may be able to make friends with whom I can study together.
        <br />
        Right now, I am using a translation tool to have what I want to write translated. 
        <br />
        But by writing articles on this blog, I would like to gradually increase the number of sentences I can write without using translation tools.
